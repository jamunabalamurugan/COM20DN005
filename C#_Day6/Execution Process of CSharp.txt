Execution Process Of C# Prog
-----------------------------------------

C# Souce Code[.cs file] - > C# Compilation[CSC Compiler] -> MSIL Code-> 

CLR (JIT compiler - translates MSIL code) -> Native Code [.exe/.dll]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Unlike Java, in C# during compilation process only, it checks for 
starting point meaning looks for Main() function
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Intermediate Language Code [MSIL like byte code in Java]
CLR [Common Langugage Runtime [like JRE in Java]]
Just In Time Compiler [JIT]

Namespace - Before Compilation
Namespace is simply a declarative area.
The purpose of namespace is to localize names of  identifiers to avoid name collisions.
Elements declared in one namespace are separate from elements declared in another.
Namespace is an important concept for library developer.
If you include two libraries both having same function prototype, then compiler will be unable to detect which one you are referring to when you invoke it.

Assembly - After Compilation-Its a Single Deployable Unit of Code which can be ported to any different machines.

Assembly in two forms
1) .Exe (Executable)
2) .dll (Dynamic Link Library)

Assembly Manifest Contains (Metadata + MSIL)

Assemble also contains PE Header,CLR Header,Meta Data,IL Code and Resources


csc /target:library /out:Shape.dll Circle.cs Rectangle.cs Triangle.cs

to verify or to see metadata of each assembly [.exe or .dll]

cmd->		ildasm

Intermediate Language dassembler meaning reading source code of byte code

Global Assemble Cache-Place where many assemblies are deployed,Central repository,It must be strongly names
Strong Name-Consiste of its simple text name,version number,culture info---pls a public key and digital signature
